          <h4>Cholangiocarcinoma</h4>
           <p>Cholangiocarcinomas can present as mass-forming lesions with distinctive characteristics:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Typically solitary but may be multifocal.</li>
                       <li>Continuous rim enhancement on arterial phase images.</li>
                       <li>Fibrotic progressive enhancement on delayed images.</li>
                       <li>Uniform appearance in both pathology and gross specimen.</li>
                       <li>Desmoplastic tumors with a targatoid appearance and hepatic retraction.</li>
                       <li>Reverse washout sign, indicating progressive enhancement with less contrast in the periphery.</li>
                    </ul>
   <p>These features, including the targatoid appearance and specific enhancement patterns, are crucial for making a precise diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. The information underscores the importance of thorough imaging analysis, encompassing CT and MR findings.</p>
